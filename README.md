# zero_Interface-Loader

The Interface-Loader .alp file uses Lombok (https://projectlombok.org/) to create data packages. At https://zerodocs.zenmo.com/ under the chapter: Lombok in AnyLogic, you can find the details to make this work within AnyLogic. The Lombok.jar file is also already in this repository.
